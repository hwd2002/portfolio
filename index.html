			<h1 style="text-align:center;">Harrison's Portfolio</h1>
			<p>&nbsp &nbsp My name is Harrison Davis. I am a programmer and an aspiring Mechanical Engineer attending college in North Carolina. In my free time, I program small games, simulators, and AI systems. I also enjoy making RC vehicles of all types to achieve my self-set goals. </p>
			<p>&nbsp &nbsp Some of my projects are viewable on this website (including this website itself!) You can use the sidebar to navigate through the different categories.</p>

			<h3 style="text-align:center;"><a href="./Programming/programming.html">My Programming Experiments and Programs</a></h3>
			<p>&nbsp &nbsp I program small games, demos, or simulations to experiment and learn about new concepts such as Neural Nets, PID loops, Matrix Multiplication, and Perspective Projection. To make this website, I learned HTML and CSS. </p>

			<h3 style="text-align:center;"><a href="./Artwork/artwork.html">My Artistic Endeavors</a></h3>
			<p>&nbsp &nbsp Apart from the graphical artwork I do for my games and other programming projects, I sketch aircraft with pencil and use Photoshop for more complicated works. I have also used charcoal from time to time. I do not consider myself an artist however I do sketch aircraft, vehicles, and concept art when I feel like it. </p>

			<h3 style="text-align:center;"><a href="./Projects/projects.html">My Projects</a></h3>
			<p>&nbsp &nbsp I frequently build PCs for myself or family members. Some of these are brand-new, while others are scrapped together from parts. I also build and fly homemade Radio Controlled aircraft as a hobby.</p>
