			<h2 style="text-align:center;">My Hobby Projects:</h2>
			<p>Most of my projects do not stay put together, as my storage space is very limited, and the practicality of these projects is also limited. Nevertheless, here are a few that I have because I use them constantly or they are recent enough for me to have pictures of:</p>
			
			<div class="imgcontainer">
				<a href="../Handheld_Project/handheld.html" target="blank"><img src="PICF.jpg"></a>
			</div>
			<p class="hvtext">A handheld Raspberry Pi system, designed and modeled in CATIA. <a href="../Handheld_Project/handheld.html">You can learn more about this project here.</a></p>

			<div class="imgcontainer">
				<img src="long_wing.jpg">
			</div>
			<p class="hvtext">This is a large RC airplane with glider-like wings spanning 5 feet (1.5 meters). This airplane I put together to carry a camera or similar payload for a longer flight. I constructed the airframe out of foam board, tape and hot glue. The airframe design was based on a Flite Test schematic, but altered slightly to fit my electronics components.</p>

			<div class="imgcontainer">
				<img src="triplane.jpg">
			</div>
			<p class="hvtext">A much smaller triplane design I built to fly around for fun. This airplane I fly frequently and has exceptional low-speed control due to the three-wing design.</p>
			<hr>
			
			<div class="imgcontainer">
				<img src="pc_1.jpg">
			</div>
			<p class="hvtext">My current working computer. I built it with off-the-shelf components and some spare parts I had. It isn't cutting-edge, but it does what I need it to.</p>
