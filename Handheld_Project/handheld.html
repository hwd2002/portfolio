					<p>My summer project was to use a Raspberry Pi I was given and incorporate it into something. I decided to make a handheld "cyberdeck" (what does that even mean?) and use some 3d modeling software I had learned about in College, specifically CATIA. <br><br>I made a requirement for the project to not alter the Pi itself so it could still be taken out and repurposed at a moment's notice. Additionally I chose to reuse as many parts lying around that I had. This resulted in the PSP thumbstick and the analog stick not matching.</p>

					<p>The project had to be downgraded several times as power issues kept occuring. Despite the large 6600mah battery, the charging circuit couldn't handle enough to power the Pi 5. A Pi 3 was substituted in, limiting the capability of the device significantly. Additionally there were issues with fitting all the components inside due to the angled case. Despite these drawbacks I consider the project a success.</p>
